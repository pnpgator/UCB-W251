Name all the layers in the network, describe what they do.

The first layer is the input layer with 24 inputs and outputs. That feeds a convolutional layer that has a kernel/filter size of 5x5 with stride of 1 step and uses a ReLU activation function. The next layer pools that using a 2x2 pooling and 2 step stride. Then another convolutional layer with 5x5 kernel/filter and but 16 filters and ReLU activation function which feeds another Pooling layer using a 3x3 pooling with stride 3. This feeds the output layer which uses a softmax probability with 10 classes (one for each digit).

Experiment with the number and size of filters in each layer. Does it improve the accuracy?

I found it very hard to compare results. In the end if you let the model run for several minutes they all seem to acheive 99%


Remove the pooling layers. Does it impact the accuracy?

Yes, removing the pooling layers seems to cap the accuracy on validation at around 0.90. 

Add one more conv layer. Does it help with accuracy?

It seems to hinder validation accuracy as well. 

Increase the batch size. What impact does it have?
Seems to hurt validation accuracy a little. 


What is the best accuracy you can achieve? Are you over 99%? 99.5%?

The results only go to 2 decimal places but sometimes I see 1 on training and 0.99 on validation. It seems that giving the model more time helps it get to 0.99 eventually.
